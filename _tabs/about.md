Core Explorer is dedicated to advancing the understanding and exploration of the way Bitcoin comes together, specifically at this time, how the repository is maintained. We seek to empower bitcoiners by providing innovative tools and insights that shed light on the collaborative efforts behind the Bitcoin project on Github.

Bitcoin doesn't need to be on Github, but it is for now.

### Sousveillance

> Sousveillance is the recording of an activity by a member of the public, rather than a person or organisation in authority [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance)

By analyzing the commit history, author and co-author interactions, and other key data points within the repository, we aim to create a more transparent and accessible environment for everyone involved. Our team has been working to develop solutions, including the Repo Explorer, Vibe Explorer, and RepEx, each designed to uncover valuable information and present it in a user-friendly manner.

We believe that by fostering a deeper understanding of the Bitcoin repository and its contributors and  maintainers we can promote a more collaborative and efficient development process which protects the integrity of the project.
