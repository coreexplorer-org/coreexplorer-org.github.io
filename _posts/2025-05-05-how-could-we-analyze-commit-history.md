Examples of ways to analyze commit history:

1. who reviews who?

2. who gets the most reviews?

3. who gets the least reviews?

4. does anybody merge their own changes?

5. when Alice is reviewing, are they typically giving positive or negative reviews for everybody, or do they express preference to some contributors over others?

6. when Bob is committing code, do they regularly get positive or negative reviews from everybody? Which reviewers fall outside the norm for those who review the work that Bob does?

7. who has reviewed the most? who has reviewed the least?
