# We're rehosted!

Since our Honorable Mention at btc++, we've updated our build system and migrated to a new hosting provider (let us know if you need a based hosting provider).

## We've also updated our repo

Code in the repo has undergone some refinement and refactoring, and we're getting back to the process of building more reliably again. Moving is always such a pain, but it's probably great for us.

## Looking ahead

One of our researchers has put together a whole slew of scripts while he was writing an article about Core, and we're going to begin the process to build mechanisms for importing that data idempotently.

Watch this space for more details!
