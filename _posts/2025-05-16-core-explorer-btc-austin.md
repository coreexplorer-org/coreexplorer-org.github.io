**Our Adventure at the btc++ Conference Hackathon in Austin**  

  

As we reflect on our experience at the btc++ conference hackathon in Austin, we can't help but feel a sense of excitement and accomplishment. The conference, which drew a very high-signal audience, i would guess 200+ attendees. The Palmer Event Center provided the perfect backdrop for our team of three to come together and [hack on the Core Explorer Kit](https://devpost.com/software/core-explorer-kit).  

  

**Goals and Challenges**  

  

Our primary goal for the hackathon was to clean up our development environment, integrate our previously unplanned projects, and unblock future development. We had a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve, but we ran into challenges collaborating on tasks that were, fundamentally, single person challenges but needed to be completed in sequence to unblock the rest of the team. These team-blocking tasks required careful coordination and communication to ensure that we were all on the same page. Despite these challenges, we were determined to push through and make the most of our time at the hackathon. (Special thanks to the crew who hosted us nearby.)

  

**The Core Explorer Kit**

  

The [Core Explorer Kit](https://github.com/coreexplorer-org/core-explorer-kit) is a comprehensive tool that consists of several key components, including a frontend, GraphQL API backend, archive storage architecture, data scraping & loading application, NGINX routing and the DB. This kit is designed to address the team's integration challenges by providing a seamless and efficient way to onboard new contributors and continue to explore the data related to Bitcoin Core's development. With the Core Explorer Kit, users can more easily get started navigating the data, and developing ways to gain valuable insights into how the sausage gets sausaged.

  

**Achievements**  

  

We are proud to say that we completed the minimum viable product (MVP) for the Core Explorer Kit during the hackathon. Our hard work paid off, and we were recognized with a small trophy and an honorable mention. This achievement was nice, and it was awesome to see all the projects who won Bitaxes... what a cool group of develoipers `:)` With the simplification of our environment, we are ablet to continue working on the project with renewed enthusiasm & with a new contributor!  

  

**Future Plans**  

  

As we look to the future, we are excited to announce the addition of Carter to our team. We plan to revisit our planning and notes from past research and development, refining our approach and making adjustments to the next steps. Our immediate next goal is to improve the web presence of the Core Explorer Kit, making it more accessible and user-friendly for the Bitcoin community. After that, we have some ideas about branch & fork comparisons, as well as some visualizations related to non-git data (e.g. IRC and Email discussions).  

  

**So, you say you want a call to action?**
