Recently, we've been discussing how to think about our codebases and how we can improve them to better serve the Bitcoin community.
Our conversation started with the question "where do we want to go with our codebases?" and led to an explanation of our current projects, which was the input to this post: 

repo_explore, vibe_explor, and repex. Each of these codebases has addressed a certain part of the problem we're facing:

## Repo Explore
[repo_explore](https://github.com/coreexplorer-org/repo_explorer) is a practical tool for scraping data from GitHub and processing it into a CSV file for analysis. To take it to the next level, we need to focus on refining the code, making it more robust and user-friendly.

## Vibe Explore
[vibe_explore](https://github.com/coreexplorer-org/CE_demo) won 2nd place at the AI-powered turbo 2hr hackathon at the Bitcoin Commons in Austin, during SXSW. In addition to speaking with our friends about our efforts over the past few years, it was really quite a delight to be recognized at the hackathon.

Vibe Explorer boasts a visually appealing front end, and expresses what we think could help surface information about developer interactions within a repository. It needs a back end to unlock its full potential. We're looking to integrate a something like this with our `repex` back end to supply data for the charts and make the application usable for exploring real information.

## repex

[repex](https://github.com/coreexplorer-org/repex), our backend application, uses a Neo4j graph database and a Rails API. Although it's still in its early stages, it shows promise for future development, particularly in creating endpoints to provide meaningful data to the front end.
As we move forward, we want to involve the Bitcoin community in our development process. We believe that transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development are essential for creating tools and resources that meet the needs of Bitcoin users and contributors.

## haaalp!!

We invite you to join the conversation, share your feedback, and contribute to our codebases. Together, we can create a more transparent, accessible, and collaborative environment for everyone involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let's work together to advance the understanding and exploration of the Bitcoin repository. Share your thoughts, suggestions, and ideas with us, and let's build a better future for Bitcoin.
